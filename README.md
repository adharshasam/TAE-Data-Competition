Upon running the code for every classification model created, csv files are created which we uploaded on the Kaggle platform 
as submission files for the TAE Data Competition 2022.

**_README:_**

✧ train.csv: This file containing 20,610 tweets with their corresponding sentiment was downloaded from the Kaggle competition platform. 
We used this as the training dataset to train our classifiers on. We would like to emphasize that no additional data was augmented with 
train.csv.

✧ Only code files for best-performing classifiers are uploaded on this repository.
  
  ✧ best-performing classifiers: 
  
    - Random Forests,
    
    - Logistic Regression &
    
    - Support Vector Machine 

The folder also contains the random_forests_predictions.csv file which we selected as our final submission. 
This csv file can be reproduced by running the Random Forests R code.
